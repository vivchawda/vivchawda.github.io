			<h1>Personal assistant
			  for the elderly			</h1>
		    <p>The project was to design a user-friendly
		      computing device which did not look intimidating
		      to the elderly. At the same time the user interface
		      and functionality of the device had to be simple
		      and yet not lose its functionality.	      </p>
		    <p>The interaction framework was built from the
		      ground up with a completely new mental model.
		      The home screen was designed around the
		      theme of incremental complexity by flattening the
		      information hierarchy. This was to shield the user
		      from becoming “lost” in the interface.	      </p>
		    <p>The visual language is defined by high contrast
		      text/visuals on a black background. This allows
		      the screen borders to merge naturally with the
		      interface and focuses the user’s attention to the
          information at hand.</p>
